title: Adding Columns
description: Adding new columns to existing tables
---

Once the table has been deployed, SchemaHero can add new columns easily. 
To add a new column to an existing table, add the column definition to the YAML manifest, and deploy it using `kubectl apply`. 
The SchemaHero operator will reconcile this table manifest with the actual database to create a plan.

SchemaHero is notified that there's a new version of the table to deploy. 
SchemaHero connects to the database and queries the current schema, including columns, constraints, indexes, primary, and foreign keys. 
SchemaHero compares the current schema with the desired schema in the new manifest, and generates the required SQL statement(s) to migrate the table schema to the new defintion.

When a new column is added, SchemaHero will generate the appropriate `alter table` commands that can be run against the database to add the new column. This will be created as a `migration` resource in the operator.
